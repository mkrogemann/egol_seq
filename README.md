Conway's Game of Life in Erlang - just to learn a bit about Erlang/OTP, functional problem solving and tools like rebar and QuickCheck.


What's next?
============

* Convert into an OTP application
* Print game state to console
* Alternative data structures (gb_tree, bit vector, ...)
* Benchmarking
* More tools (dyalizer, ...)
* Concurrency (cell = actor?)
